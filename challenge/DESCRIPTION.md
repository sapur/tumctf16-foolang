**Session Transcript**

*TA:* Technical Assistance, what can I do you for?

*IT:* OK, so here's the thing: We told that script kiddie to store our flag for 
us. Not in plaintext, of course, but in a more secure way.

*TA:* So you lost it?

*IT:* Well, we have the program and the encoded key. And that kid knows nothing 
about cryptography, that's for sure!

*TA:* I didn't see that coming! So, how may I service you?

*IT:* You see, those kids nowadays use all those fancy programming languages 
... I can't even read his code!

*TA:* Have you thought about giving it to the CTF community? They lust for 
this!

*IT:* Hm, actually, that's a brilliant idea!

*TA:* I am very pleased to have satisfied you.
